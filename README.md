# bf

This is another attempt to get into programming with C. This interpreter
really needs optimization in terms of loop / bracket matching, but I have not found a useful solution for this problem yet.

## Building
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install make gcc -y
$ git clone https://github.com/mooxmirror/bf
$ cd bf
$ ./bf examples/echo.bf
Hello World!
```
